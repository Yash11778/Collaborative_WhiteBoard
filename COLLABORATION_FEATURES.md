## 🔄 Real-Time Events

### Canvas Events (Frontend → Backend → Other Clients)
```javascript
// Drawing events
socket.emit('draw-element')      → socket.emit('element-drawn')
socket.emit('update-element')    → socket.emit('element-updated')
socket.emit('delete-element')    → socket.emit('element-deleted')

// Text editing (NEW!)
canvas.on('text:changed')        → socket.emit('update-element')

// Selection awareness (NEW!)
canvas.on('selection:created')   → socket.emit('object-selected')
canvas.on('selection:cleared')   → socket.emit('object-deselected')

// Tool awareness (NEW!)
handleToolChange()               → socket.emit('tool-changed')

// View sync
handleZoomIn/Out/Reset()         → socket.emit('zoom-changed')
handleGridToggle()               → socket.emit('grid-toggled')

// Cursor tracking
canvas.on('mouse:move')          → socket.emit('cursor-move')

// Chat
sendMessage()                    → socket.emit('send-message')
```

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **User A** draws a rectangle
2. Canvas detects `object:added` event
3. Emits `draw-element` to server with object data
4. Server broadcasts `element-drawn` to all other users
5. **User B & C** receive the event and add the rectangle to their canvas
6. Everyone sees the same whiteboard in real-time! 🎉

## 🚀 Testing Collaboration

To test the collaboration:

1. Open the same board URL in **two different browser windows** (or two different devices)
2. Start drawing in one window → See it appear instantly in the other
3. Type text in one window → Watch it appear character by character in the other
4. Change tools in one window → See a notification in the other
5. Zoom/toggle grid in one window → Watch the other window sync
6. Select an object in one window → See blue border indicator in the other

## 💡 Performance Optimizations

- **Cursor updates**: Throttled to 50ms (max 20 updates/second)
- **Text editing**: Throttled to 300ms after last keystroke
- **Object updates**: Sent only on modification complete
- **Socket reconnection**: Automatic with exponential backoff

## 🎨 Visual Indicators

- **Blue border**: Someone else is editing this object
- **Colored cursors**: Other users' mouse positions
- **Toast notifications**: Tool changes by other users
- **Connection badge**: Socket connection status
- **User count**: Number of active collaborators
- **Chat badge**: Unread message indicator

Your whiteboard is now a **fully collaborative, real-time experience**! 🚀✨
